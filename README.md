# Team TrainData 
Repo for MHC 399 Independent Study / Research

**Project Goal:** Use the **visualization**, **polling data**, and **other statistics** to build a case that CUNY students could benefit from reduced transit fares (i.e. Fair Fares Program).

**Our primary task** is to use MTA public datasets to build a case that CUNY students could benefit from reduced fares. Using the Origin-Destination dataset, we want to discover any potential correlations between Public Colleges, Private Colleges, and Highly Enforced Stations. The main question we want to answer is “are subway fares a barrier to education for CUNY students?”

**Our secondary task** is to conduct a survey/poll to get a better understanding of how reduced fares could impact CUNY students. The data collected will hopefully help us build a better case for reduced transit fares for CUNY students.


**Poll Survey Analaysis** 
In the poll survey we currently as of (3/21/25) have around 180 responses and from this we will analyze more so the qualitative data to further support the primary task in order to build a better case for reduced transit fares for CUNY students.
